**üöß Important note üöß:** MODI is currently under reconstruction, thus you may find some inconsistencies in its documentation. In case you have problems using the code, please do not hesitate to contact us.

**MODI** (**M**ulticommodity **O**ptimal transport **D**ynamics on **I**mages) is a Python implementation of the algorithms used in:

- [1] Alessandro Lonardi\*, Diego Baptista\*, and Caterina De Bacco. <i>Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification</i>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2023.1089114">Front. Phys. 11:1089114</a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02938">arXiv</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/aleable/MODI/tree/main/misc/POSTER_MODI.pdf">poster</a>] [<a href="https://www.treedom.net/en/page/register?id=49Z-KEWX">CO‚ÇÇ compensation</a>].

This is a scheme capable of performing supervised classification by finding multicommodity optimal transport paths between a pair of images.

**If you use this code, please cite [1].**<br/>
The symbol ‚Äú*‚Äù denotes equal contribution.


## Requirements

All the dependencies needed to run the algorithm can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ modi-flows
```
Please note that one of the dependencies, scikit-umfpack, may not be easily installable using pip3. In this case, it is recommended to use conda for installing it:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-umfpack
```
In case that the installation of `modi-flows` fails due to this, install first `scikit-umfpack` first and then try installing our package again from `pip`.

Now, you are ready to use the code! To do so, you can simply use the notebook ```dashboard.ipynb```, from which you can access our solver. <br/>


## What's included

- ```code```: contains all the scripts necessary to run MODI, and a user-friendly Jupyter notebook (```dashboard.ipynb```) to interact with the code and visualize the results.
- ```data/input```: contains a small sample of images taken from [2]. These can be preprocessed using ```code/dashboard.ipynb```. The original dataset can be directly downloaded as a .zip file [from the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QDHYST)
- ```setup.py```: setup file to build the Python environment.
- ```misc```: supplementary files (poster of MODI).
