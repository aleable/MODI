**MODI** (**M**ulticommodity **O**ptimal transport **D**ynamics on **I**mages) is a Python implementation of the algorithms used in:

- [1] Alessandro Lonardi\*, Diego Baptista\*, and Caterina De Bacco. <i>Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification</i>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2023.1089114">Front. Phys. 11:1089114</a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02938">arXiv</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/aleable/MODI/tree/main/misc/POSTER_MODI.pdf">poster</a>] [<a href="https://www.treedom.net/en/page/register?id=49Z-KEWX">CO‚ÇÇ compensation</a>].

This is a scheme capable of performing supervised classification by finding multicommodity optimal transport paths between a pair of images.

**If you use this code, please cite [1].**<br/>
The symbol ‚Äú*‚Äù denotes equal contribution.


## Requirements

All the dependencies needed to run the algorithm can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install modi-flows
```

Please note that as of the latest release, the `scikit-umfpack` package is no longer a mandatory requirement for `modi-flows`. However, we highly recommend installing it to take advantage of enhanced performance. If you choose to install `scikit-umfpack`, it can be easily obtained from the conda repository:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-umfpack
```
Now, you are ready to use the code! To do so, you can simply use the notebook ```dashboard.ipynb```, from which you can access our solver. <br/>


Here's the directory structure:

## What's included

- `src/modi_flows`: Contains all the scripts necessary to run MODI.
- `notebooks`: Holds user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, such as `dashboard.ipynb`, which allow you to interact with the code and visualize results.
- `data`: Contains input data used in the examples.
  - `input`: Holds a small sample of images taken from [2]. These images can be preprocessed using `code/dashboard.ipynb`. The complete dataset can be downloaded as a .zip file from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QDHYST).
- `misc`: Includes supplementary files such as the MODI poster.
- `tests`: Contains test scripts to validate the functionality of the code.
- `docs`: Contains documentation files, including Sphinx configuration and source files.
