## What's included

- ```dashboard.ipynb```: Jupyter notebook containing an easy-to-use interface with MODI
- ```utils.ipynb```: auxiliary functions needed by ```dashboard.ipynb```
- ```main.py```: main function containing the MODI class, and a ```preprocessing()``` function to build the problem, given a pair of images
- ```initialization.py```: construction of the transport network and of the multicommodity problem
- ```dynamics.py```: finite difference scheme to solve the multicommodity dynamics

## Requirements

All the dependencies needed to run the algorithm can be installed using ```setup.py```.
This script can be executed with the command:

```bash
python setup.py
```

Now, you are ready to use the code! To do so, you can simply use the notebook ```dashboard.ipynb```, from which you can access our solver. <br/>

## How to use

### Parameters

The parameters you can pass to MODI are introduced in ```dashboard.ipynb```. They are:

- *Problem construction*
    - ```otp_alg``` = ```"multicom"``` or ```"unicom"```: choose how many commodities you want to run the dynamics with. Set ```multicom``` for M = 3, i.e., to use colored images, and M = 1 to use grayscale ones
    - ```sigma``` (```type=float```): standard deviation for an additional Gaussian smoothing of the images (if needed)
    - ```pooling_size``` (```type=int```): kernel size for an additional average pooling of the images (if needed)
    - ```theta``` (```type=float```): 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, convex combination weight between pixels' positions and colors contribution to the ground cost
    - ```alpha``` (```type=float```): α ≥ 1/2 (suggested), penalty for Kirchhoff's law relaxation

- *Dynamics parameters*
    - ```time_step``` (```type=float```): Δt > 0, time step for the finite difference discretization of the dynamics
    - ```time_tol``` (```type=int```): upper bound on the number of time steps (safety variable)
    - ```tol``` (```type=float```):  threshold for convergence of the multicommodity dynamics
    - ```beta``` (```type=float```): 0 < β < 2, regulatory parameter for transport paths consolidation

- *Misc*
    - ```VERBOSE``` (```type=bool```): print info while running the scheme

## I/O format

### Input

If you want to test the code you need to pass as input files images as ```np.arrays```, with the standard formatting used for RGB data. Particularly, an ```image``` variable should be an array with shape ```(w,h,3)``` = (width, height, color channels), and with all its entries converted to integers in the range [0, 255].

To faciliate the understanding of this preprocessing step, we include the function ```utils.preprocessing()``` in ```dashboard.ipynb```, where a subset of [Jena Flowers](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QDHYST) is converted to the desired format.
### Output

The outputs returned by our scheme are:

- ```j```: optimal transport cost at convergence
- ```self.r```: tensor H, transported in the multicommodity problem
- ```self.s```: tensor G, transported in the multicommodity problem
- ```self.c```: ground cost matrix used to build the transport network

These can be serialized using the functions ```exec()``` in ```main.py```. In case one wants to export only the three latter variables without running the multicommodity dynamics, the function ```setup_only()``` in ```main.py```can be utilized.


## Additional implementation details

### Transport network setup

The multicommodity dynamics is executed on the transport network K, which is build in ```initialization.py```. In detail, its construction is made of the following steps:

```python
self.c, self.r, self.s = sparsunb(*args)    # 1.
edges = index_edges(*args)                  # 2a.
length = cost_edge(*args)                   # 2b.
self.B, self.length = topology(*args)       # 2c.
self.forcing = rhs_construction(*args)      # 3.
```

1. given a complete bipartite nertwork between a pair of images, we sparsify it using the trimming proposed in [1]. Moreover, we extend the optimal transport formulation to account for G and H with different total mass
2. (a) we extract the list of edges of K, and (b-c) its incidence matrix. In these last two steps, we also assign a cost to each link
3. we construct the forcing S from G and H

### Convergence criteria

The convergence criteria we choose for our algorithms is the following. We stop the code when the cost difference between two consecutive time steps is below the threshold ```tol```. Schematically:
```python
dc = abs(cost_update - cost)/self.time_step
if dc < self.tol and it > 5:    # a lower bound on the number of iteration (it) is added for safety
    conv = True
```


## Usage examples

For a basic usage example of the code you can simply take a look at ```dashboard.ipynb```. <br/>
The execution of MODI is performed in two steps:
- *Problem setup*, i.e. construction of the transport network given a pair of images:

```python
from main import *  # import preprocessing scripts
# [...] you may want to load other packages

otp_alg = "multicom" # "multicom"/"unicom" for M=3 and M=1, respectively
sigma = 0.5          # in case additional gaussian smoothing of the images is desired
pooling_size = 1     # in case further pooling of the images is desired
theta = 0.5          # convex weight for the construction of C
alpha = 0.5          # penalty for Kirchhoff's law (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5459199)


# select two samples, here taken from the Jena Flowers 30 Dataset
img1 = flowers_dataframe["image"][0]
img2 = flowers_dataframe["image"][1]

# serialize the ground cost, and the transport tensors G, H
C, g, h = preprocessing(img2, img1, otp_alg, pooling_size, sigma, theta)
thresh = 0.05  # trimming threshold (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5459199)
```
- *Execution*, you just need to run:
```python
from main import MODI # import multicommodity dynamics class

# parameters used to execute the multicommodity dynamics
time_step = 0.5  # forward Euler discretization time step
tol = 1e-1       # convergence tolerance
time_tol = 1e3   # stopping time step limit (for safety)
beta = 1.0       # regularization parameter

modi = MODI(g, h, C,
            beta=beta,
            dt=time_step,
            tol=tol,
            time_tol=time_tol,
            alpha=alpha,
            t=thresh,
            verbose=VERBOSE)

ouputs = modi.exec() # as described in in Sec. I/O Format
```
